# Build Sprint 1
// hello there github

To begin work on this ticket, make sure you have finished: 
1. Getting locally setup. 
2. Completed the `Onboarding Module` in your course. 

### Objective

Deliver the following: 

- Landing page that matches the landing page on the [screenshot](examples/LandingPage.jpeg). 
- While you may make small changes to styles, the page should mostly match what is provided. 

### Relevant Files

Your React code and styles should be added to `src/components/pages/Landing/index.jsx`. 

> There are comments in the file to help guide you. 

### Guidance

Your job is to finish building the landing page for this application. To build this, you will add to the existing React component structure and alter styles to match the provided reference on the deployed site. 

You must: 

1. Focus on making the landing page for the browser. You can adjust the styles for mobile and tablet in the stretch goals of this project after you complete all 3 tickets.

2. Use the exact imports on the `LandingPage/index.jsx` file. This way you have the same photos and libraries available to you as the deployed site. 

3. Refer to the Tailwind docs to assist in your styling efforts. [Tailwind docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation)

4. Make this project your own, but keep the integrity of the main files so that the app can render and work when you wish to present it. 

## Deliverables 

Submit the following in your course: 

- Link to your forked repo with the added code for the landing page
- Link to a Loom video answering the prompt in the `Submit Your Deliverables` assignment in your course
